## Javascript Portfolio
=======================
Welcome to my javascript. This is all of the work I have done in Javascript/jQuery and HTML/CSS formats. Here's a quick rundown


#### Object Oriented Javascript
* hangman       - The classic game that uses an API to conjure up impossible words! You only get tries...
* tic-tac-toe   - A 2 player version of this old favorite.

#### API Javascript
* Spotify       - Using the spotify API to search albums, create informative results and even play a sample.

#### Basic Javascript
* factorial     - A quick tool to factor any number up to 170.
* fibonacci     - Provides the (n)th value in the fibonacci sequence.
* leap year     - Identifies if a year meets the leap year requirements.
* number        - Converts a number up to 21 integers long into its written form.
* pig latin     - anslatesTray asesphray intoay igpay atinlay (Translates phrases into pig latin).
* title case    - Convert sentences in any case into proper title case, ignoring standard words ('a', 'and', 'to', etc..)
* triangle      - Identifies a triange as scalene, isosceles or equilateral given 3 sides. Will also recognize an impossible triangle.
